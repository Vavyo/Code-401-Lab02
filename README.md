# Code-401-Lab02 - Unit Testing

**Author**: Nathan Hall
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This program acts as a currency tracker like an ATM. It allows depositing and withdrawing from an account.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Clone the repository to your machine then open the solution in Microsoft Visual Studio. In order to build you need .NET 5.0. Once you have the dependancies just build or run the app through MSVS.

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->
Example:
```
Welcome to the Bank of Gaming!
help
balance - Display your current balance.
withdraw:[amount] - Withdraws [amount] from your account.
deposit:[amount] - Deposit [amount] into your account.
help - Displays available commands.
exit - Leaves the App.

exit
```

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This app uses the .NET 5.0 librarys with the C# language.
